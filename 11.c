This is a C program that prints all the even numbers within a given range. The user inputs the start and end of the range. The program then checks each number within the range to see if itâ€™s even. If it is, the program prints the number. The check is done using the modulus operator (%), which gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. In this case, if a number modulo 2 equals 0, that means the number is even.
 #include<stdio.h>
int main () {
	int start,end;
	printf("enter the start and end\n");
	scanf("%d %d",&start,&end);
	printf("the even numbers that lies within the given range are:");
	while (start<=end) {
		if (start%2==0) {
			printf("%d\n",start);
		}
		++start;
	}
	return 0;
}
